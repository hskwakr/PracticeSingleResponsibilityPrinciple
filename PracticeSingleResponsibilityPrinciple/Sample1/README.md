# Sample1
This sample is practiced using the article of  [Single Responsibility Principle: The Art of Great Code | Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/software/single-responsibility-principle "Single Responsibility Principle: The Art of Great Code | Toptal")

## Structure
- Before directory  
The code samples before applying the principal. 
I focused an `OrderController` class.  
That class has many jobs.  
  > For every little change, the developer needs to change the entire controllerâ€™s code. 

- After directory  
The code samples after applying the principal.
  - Apply SRP  
    > The class Controllers should only control the overall process, and not actually house every bit of logic of the process.
